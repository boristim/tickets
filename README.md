**Task conditions:**
_As a trial assignment I would like to ask you to write a script that retrieves the cheapest tickets for each available section for the certain event ID from Viagogo website. For example: 
For the following event ID 3412160  
I need to get the cheapest options for sections 101,102,103,106â€¦..Floor, Upper Tier, etc.. I am expecting the script to work in the following way: I put an event ID in a certain row in a config file, then launch the script which downloads me all the necessary data in the txt/csv format. No browser automation tools and libraries are allowed, only pure http requests._
